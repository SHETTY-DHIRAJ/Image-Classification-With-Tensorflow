# Image-Classification-With-Tensorflow
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend to build and train a Neural Network for image classification. It involves developing a model that accurately recognizes hand-written digits from images, with a focus on data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
